# Cartoon-Image-Using-K-Means-Clustering

Using the help of K-Means Clustering Algorithm, creating a sketch version of any image.

This project uses the **K-Means Clustering Algorithm** in order to identify the various colors in an image, creates clusters of the same 
and then returns a compressed image with a reduced number of colors, which is defined by K (here, **K=12**).

For instance.
